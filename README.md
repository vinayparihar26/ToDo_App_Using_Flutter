📱 Flutter Hive CRUD App Description
This is a simple ToDo-style CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed using Flutter and Hive (a lightweight NoSQL database for local storage). The app allows users to:

✅ Add new records with name and email
✏️ Edit existing records
❌ Delete unwanted records
🔄 View updates in real-time using ValueListenableBuilder

It uses:
Hive for persistent local storage
hive_flutter for Flutter-specific Hive integration
showModalBottomSheet for input UI
ListView.builder to dynamically list and manage data

This project is a great example of local database integration with Flutter, ideal for small offline apps like contact lists, notes, or simple task managers.
